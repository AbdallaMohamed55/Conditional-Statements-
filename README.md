# Conditional-Statements-

To study and implement C++ decision making statements

Aim: The aim is to study and implement various decision-making statements in C++ such as if, if-else, if-else-if, and switch-case. This helps control the flow of execution based on different conditions.

Procedure:

Write a program using a simple if statement to check a condition and execute a block of code.

Implement an if-else statement to handle two alternatives based on a condition.

Use an if-else-if ladder to manage multiple conditions in a sequence.

Write a program to demonstrate the switch-case statement for multiple choice decision making.

Take input from the user to evaluate different conditions.

Display corresponding messages based on the conditions.

Compile and run each program to verify logical correctness.

Conclusion: This experiment gave a comprehensive understanding of decision-making constructs in C++. It demonstrated how these statements can control the program flow based on conditions, enabling the development of logical and interactive applications.
